"Space Exploration Technologies Corporation (SpaceX) is a space-transportation startup company founded by Elon Musk. It designs, manufactures, and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft. It is developing the partially reusable launch vehicles Falcon 1 and Falcon 9. Originally based in El Segundo, SpaceX now operates out of Hawthorne, California, USA. SpaceX was founded in June 2002 by Musk who had invested $100 million of his own money in the company as of March 2006. In January 2005, SpaceX bought a 10% stake in Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. SpaceX had 160 employees in November 2005, and more than 500 by July 2008. The launch crew in the Marshall Islands has 25 people, 6 in mission control. This small number, compared to similar space launch companies, is part of cost reduction. Musk sees other space-launch services' high prices as supporting unnecessary bureaucracy. He's stated that one of his goals is to improve the cost and reliability of access to space by a factor of ten. Elon Musk stated after the failure of the third Falcon 1 flight attempt, ""As a precautionary measure to guard against the possibility of flight 3 not reaching orbit, SpaceX recently accepted a significant investment. Combined with our existing cash reserves, that ensures we will have more than sufficient funding on hand to continue launching Falcon 1 and develop Falcon 9 and Dragon""; on August 4, SpaceX released further details; they had accepted a USD$20 million equity investment from the Founder's Fund.

"Herbalife Nutrition began 36 years ago and inspired to be a beacon of wellness within the community. With the simple goal of changing nutrition from something inaccessible to a completely achievable way of living. Holistic approaches to nutrition that focus on the happiness and healthiness of our customers are our goals, and we believe it is where much of mainstream nutrition has gone astray. The decades of experience have made it possible for Herbalife and its independent distributors to reach out to 88 different countries who need access to better nutrition. A world leader in the wellness industry, Herbalife Nutrition has a yearly turnover of $ 8.2 billion and is a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Our success is completely owed to the quality of our product and the passion of our independent distributors and customers. Each supplement is packed with the most effective mix of nutrition that is targeted to eradicate some of the problems that today’s societies face. Between a growth in morbid obesity, lack of women’s-based nutritional supplements, and general miseducation on how nutrition works, many communities worldwide struggle with basic health. In addition to catering supplements to support specific health goals and lifestyles, our nutrition is sold by independent distributors who help customers on their path to wellness through supportive lifestyle change. Our 8,000 employees worldwide also support our goal of creating a healthy world. Herbalife Nutrition’s reputation is also supported by world-class athletes who know very well how hard it can be to maintain a particular healthy lifestyle. The sponsorship of athletes and teams like Cristiano Ronaldo, The LA Galaxy, and multiple Olympic teams show our customers that they are only getting the best nutrition and that becoming as healthy as a world-class athlete starts with proper nutrition. But for the team at Herbalife Nutrition, giving back to the community does not stop with selling a product aimed at transforming a lifestyle. Herbalife Nutrition is also committed to giving back to the community out of corporate responsibility. That is why we founded the Herbalife Family Foundation (HFF) and our Casa Herbalife programs. These are focused on bringing nutrition to needed families and children worldwide in an effort to transform their lives. As global leaders in nutrition, we know that good nutrition can mean the difference in a successful life, and we want to pass our success on to every person that we meet.   Further accomplishments include:      a)  36 Years of Experience in the field of wellness,     b)  Officially operating in 88 Countries in the field of health and lifestyle     c)  Turnover of $6.4 Billion (approx.) in year 2013 going to be $8.2 billion     d)  Publicly Traded Company in New York Stock Exchange...with growing financial status.     e)  World Leader in the Wellness Industry, we deal in international distribution of goods and services          f)  listed on the prestigious New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).",Herbalife Nutrition Ltd.,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/herbalife-ltd,"Direct Sales, Fitness, Health Care, Nutrition","Los Angeles, California, United States",Herbalife is a global nutrition company that has helped people pursue healthy.,1,IPO,1450000000,USD,1450000000,"4,695",$1B to $10B,Active,1980-01-01,year,2004-12-23,day,,http://www.herbalife.com,5001-10000,1,"Food and Beverage, Health Care, Sales and Marketing, Sports","Credit Suisse, Rabobank",2,2,2,Made Acquisitions,Public,

"RYFF is a new company created by senior executives from within the entertainment industry. CEO Roy Taylor led the foundation of NVIDIA (NVDA) in Europe and previous to RYFF he was acting head of AMD (AMD) Studios in Hollywood.  Together they have developed a new process incorporating video game technology with photorealistic 3D models inserted into film and TV broadcast,  to disrupt the $23B branded entertainment industry. Branded entertainment in movies & TV shows is currently a $23B globally ($10B USA) industry available only to major brands and growing at 17% CAGR.  Simultaneously, interstitial TV advertising is in decline whilst proliferating content (487 new scripted shows in 2017). This means a declining return on assets. At the same time, ad-skipping and ad-blocking are devastating traditional revenue models. Remarkably, branded entertainment today is a manual process whereby products are delivered by hand to set. Additionally, simple adjustments in camera movement such as a pan left or right can obfuscate a brand requiring reshoots. Brands are also fixed in perpetuity and not able to be edited or updated. By introducing digital technology, we can bring branded entertainment into the modern world and disrupt incumbents creating a multibillion-dollar cutting edge business. Consumers get a new option for content instead of pay a monthly subscription OR accept adverts they can get premium content for free accepting dynamic digital brand integration for brands they like.

Founded by a team of dental professionals and software engineers, Dentulu provides a number of HIPAA compliant Telemedicine services aimed at securing medical information, increasing access to virtual dental care and mobile dentists. Dentulu was the first to market with their mobile dental app and is available on mobile phones, tablets, desktop computers as well as online through the Dentulu Web Portal. Dentulu is also the first company in the world to go directly to consumers with the only dental wearable in the market in the form of a patient intra-oral camera that is used by patients to show a dental professional located in another physical location the inside of their oral cavity. Dentulu's proprietary software was developed by in house developers and incorporates all facets of Teledentistry with the intention of increasing access to virtual dental care. Dentulu provides 24/7 Emergency Dentists available to anyone using their mobile app and allowing consumers with dental emergencies to connect with a licensed dentist for consultations, referrals, 2nd opinions, and even medications.  Dentulu Teledentistry also supports mobile dentists and mid-level practitioners who currently provide mobile dental services to consumers, senior living enters, schools, and under-served communities. With similar functions and features of the Uber app, Dentulu matches up patients to local providers on the Dentulu network along with communication tools, payment gateway systems, product stores, and a review platform. Mobile dentists and RDHAP clinicians can use the Dentulu mobile app to connect with patients and also maintain continuity of care with existing patients.  Dentulu also has a non profit 501 (c) 3 called The Dentulu Smiles Foundation which provides Teledentistry solutions to volunteer groups, NGO's, and other non profits that provide remote dental and medical assistance to developing countries and at risk groups.

Cameras can also be left with a variety of different institutions as an educational tool and emergency tool for dental emergencies where a dentists involvement is necessary .  Dentulu's software allows dental professionals to establish potential patients as patients of record solving problems faced by clear aligner companies such as Smile Direct Club, Candid, and Invisalign who require a dentist to see the patient first and establish the patient as a patient of record.

"While a scholarship athlete at UCLA, TOCA founder Eddie Lewis continually searched for avenues to improve his game. Though a starter on one of the top college soccer teams in the nation, Eddie realized achieving his goal of playing at an elite level required him to improve his technical skills, particularly his first touch. When he learned the National Champion UCLA basketball team often practiced shooting into a smaller-sized hoop, Eddie decided to incorporate this reduced size training methodology into soccer. He began training with tennis balls during his junior year in college, trapping rebounding balls with both feet. Noticing the positive effect this was having on his technique, Eddie purchased a tennis ball machine. This provided mass repetition, accelerating his improvement and putting his game on a trajectory for success. He entered the MLS after his senior year, as a last round draft pick. Three years later, he was named an MLS All-Star and was a starter for the US Men’s National Team. After four years in the MLS, Fulham FC purchased Eddie’s contract, and Eddie joined them the year they won promotion into the English Premier League. Eddie played professionally in Europe for nearly a decade, and competed on the US Men’s National Team in two World Cups. Throughout every step of his career, Eddie consistently employed his small-ball mass repetition training to improve and perfect his core skills. As his 15-year professional career came to a close, Eddie launched TOCA to gives other soccer players the same opportunity to elevate their game. The first TOCA Touch Trainer was a relatively simple machine able to precisely deliver small soccer balls at specified speeds and locations. This has since evolved with years of meticulous testing and research into the cutting-edge turnkey soccer training system of today. In 2013, TOCA opened its first purpose-built Training Center in Southern California. Word of Eddie’s company, machine and program spread fast. TOCA’s Training Centers are now a destination for soccer players of all levels and ages – from complete beginners to members of both the US Men’s and Women’s National Teams. TOCA established its UK operations in May 2017 to bring the TOCA revolution to where the game started.

"Marketing has changed, and traditional interruptive advertising, like commercials in a TV show, or pop up ads on a website just don’t influence consumers like they used to. That means advertisers aren’t seeing the results they need, and content creators aren’t seeing the revenue. As an advertiser, you want your products embedded inside the content, instead. Like a Mac being used in a movie or TV show, Whole Foods integrating into a YouTube video, or Nike sponsoring a local event. We understand that you want your brand to enhance what consumers experience, not interrupt it. As a content creator, you want to work with more advertisers to help them reach your audience in useful, fun and authentic ways that are also profitable for you. But you can’t just buy and sell product placements or other sponsorships like you can traditional ads, so we’re building the marketplace to make it possible, online and offline, across all media channels. You could say we’re the match.com of brand integration. Here’s how it works. For content creators who want to work with advertisers, just create a free account on Content BLVD, add your media properties, and list the specific opportunities you want advertisers to see, like product placements, paid reviews or other sponsorships. It’s up to you the kinds of deals you want to sell. Our marketplace helps advertisers find you to get more deals done. For advertisers looking to integrate your products into consumer content, you can filter and browse placement opportunities by channel, reach, demographics and topics. You can follow content creators that could be a good fit for your brand, and message them about opportunities you want to explore.

"Today, brands and retailers rely heavily on marketplaces such as Amazon, eBay and Walmart to move inventory.  In addition, they spend significant sums with Google and Facebook to drive awareness and traffic, often with minimal ROI. MassGenie helps brands and retailers reduce their reliance on marketplaces, while decreasing their advertising investments with Google and Facebook by leveraging our patent pending Power Buy SaaS and AI/ML. MassGenie’s journey  was started in early 2015 by inventor and female Co-Founder, Thu Truong https://www.linkedin.com/in/thutruong/, who created  the Power Buy concept and infrastructure. Power Buys are short term, volume-based offers where buyers can use their social media influence to crowdsource demand. We spent two years developing the Power Buy technology, including creating a marketplace to prove the concept. A patent was filed for the Power Buy concept and technology in early 2016.  The MassGenie Marketplace officially launched in mid 2017.  Utilizing the Power Buy technology, buyers were able to leverage the power of social shopping and sharing to drive prices down. Not only did MassGenie prove the Power Buy concept, our marketplace growth was impressive. GMV grew from $311K in 2017, to $4.6 million in 2018, to $7.7 million in the first half of 2019.   MassGenie is now moving onto the next chapter of our journey, which is to make the Power Buy technology available to brands and retailers worldwide. Any brand or retailer with an ecommerce site via Shopify, Magento and BigCommerce or their own custom site, can take advantage of the Power Buy via a SaaS offering. MassGenie has also established strategic partnerships with a number of major ecommerce companies in Asia to help grow the Power Buy concept throughout that region.  MassGenie has also been working on our AL/ML engine for predictive analytics and demand sensing for Power Buy. This will allow us to service those brands and retailers that have the Power Buy SaaS technology on their own ecommerce site with AI-driven solutions while delivering optimized pricing and cross-sell, upsell and retention insights.",MassGenie,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/massgenie,"Artificial Intelligence, Communities, Crowdsourcing, E-Commerce, Group Buying, Machine Learning, Marketplace, SaaS, Social Shopping","Irvine, California, United States",SaaS & AI ecommerce solutions for brands and retailers,4,,4700000,USD,4700000,"20,451",$1M to $10M,Active,2016-04-01,day,,,For Profit,http://www.massgenie.com,51-100,3,"Artificial Intelligence, Commerce and Shopping, Community and Lifestyle, Data and Analytics, Science and Engineering, Software","SV FRONTIER, Kohei Terada, Bruce Watanabe",2,3,,,Private,

" Waiakea Water is a bottled water company founded on three pillars: health, sustainability, and ethics. Beyond providing consumers with healthy, tasty water sourced from the active Mauna Loa volcano on the Big Island of Hawaii, Waiakea aims to maintain and prioritize the environment, as well as give back to disadvantaged communities. Health - The Water Waiakea Water flows from the peaks of the Mauna Loa volcano through porous, mineral-rich rock, enriching the water and making it naturally alkaline and full of electrolytes. Waiakea Water is one of the most alkaline natural waters currently available, with a pH of 8.8 and a TDS of 62. Sustainability - The Process from Start to Finish The source of Waiakea Water has a 1.4 billion gallon per day recharge rate. As a result, Waiakea bottles less than .0001 of 1% of this. Even further, Waiakea uses low-emissions vehicles to transport the water. The bottles that hold Waiakea Water are 100% RPET, which results in a carbon footprint that is 90% smaller than that of traditional plastic bottles, and, recently, Waiakea announced that they would be transitioning to fully degradable bottles in the near future. They are also the only bottled water company to be certified CarbonNeutral®. Ethics - Giving Back Waiakea has partnered with PumpAid to provide clean water to disadvantaged communities. For every liter of Waiakea Water purchased, Waiakea donates 1 week of clean water to those in need in Africa and throughout the world through the help of their partner organization.
